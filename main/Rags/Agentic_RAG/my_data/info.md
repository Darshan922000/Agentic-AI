Journey & Background
My journey began with a profound interest in physics and math, leading me to pursue Mechanical Engineering. Despite early success as a college football player—including winning a university championship—a serious injury redirected my path. During recovery, I immersed myself in psychology, philosophy, economics, and blockchain, and soon after discovered Python programming through a friend’s recommendation. Under exceptional mentorship, I built projects like a Tic-Tac-Toe game using pandas DataFrame, setting the foundation for my technical career.
The spark for Artificial Intelligence was ignited when I witnessed the AlphaGo versus Lee Sedol match. Relocating to Canada, I transitioned into Process Quality Engineering, where I honed my data analysis skills. I deepened my expertise by completing Andrew Ng’s Machine Learning specialization, attending a comprehensive bootcamp on Data Science, ML, DL, and NLP, and studying Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics (AIDI) at Durham College.
